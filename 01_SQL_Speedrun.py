1. Find and delete duplicates.

Ans.

first method using CTE:



WITH CTE_Duplicates AS (
    SELECT 
        Email,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Email ORDER BY UserID) AS RowNum
    FROM 
        UsersTable
)
SELECT 
    Email
FROM 
    CTE_Duplicates
WHERE 
    RowNum > 1;


Delete: (You cannot directly use cte for delete in sql server)


WITH CTE_Duplicates AS (
    SELECT 
        Email,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Email ORDER BY UserID) AS RowNum
    FROM 
        UsersTable 
)
DELETE 
FROM Users
WHERE UserID IN (
    SELECT UserID
    FROM CTE_Duplicates
    WHERE RowNum > 1
);






    
second method using Group By:
    

SELECT 
    Email, 
    COUNT(*) AS DuplicateCount
FROM 
    Users -- Replace with your table name
GROUP BY 
    Email
HAVING 
    COUNT(*) > 1;


Delete:

WITH DuplicateEmails AS (
    SELECT 
        Email, 
        COUNT(*) AS DuplicateCount
    FROM 
        Users -- Replace with your table name
    GROUP BY 
        Email
    HAVING 
        COUNT(*) > 1
)
DELETE FROM Users
WHERE UserID NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(UserID)
    FROM Users
    GROUP BY Email
);

Nth highest salary

WITH RankedSalaries AS (
    SELECT 
        Salary,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS SalaryRank
    FROM Employees
)
SELECT Salary
FROM RankedSalaries
WHERE SalaryRank = 4;



SELECT DISTINCT Salary
FROM Users
ORDER BY Salary DESC
OFFSET 3 ROWS 
FETCH NEXT 1 ROW ONLY;

Running sum in SQL


SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    Salary,
    SUM(Salary) OVER (ORDER BY EmployeeID) AS RunningSum
FROM 
    Employees
ORDER BY 
    EmployeeID;

    


    SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    Salary,
    SUM(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY EmployeeID ORDER BY EmployeeID) AS RunningSum
FROM 
    Employees
ORDER BY 
    EmployeeID;

The order of execution for a query is different from the written order. 
Hereâ€™s the logical order of execution:

1. FROM: Specifies the tables involved in the query and performs joins.

2. WHERE: Filters rows based on specified conditions.

3. GROUP BY: Groups rows based on specified columns.

4. HAVING: Filters groups based on specified conditions.

5. SELECT: Selects the columns to be returned in the result set.

6. ORDER BY: Sorts the result set based on specified columns.

7. TOP: Limits the number of rows returned in the result set.
